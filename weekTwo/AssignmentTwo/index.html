      <h2>Assignment Two</h2>
      <h2>Response to Vannevar Bush's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/" target="_blank">"As We May Think(1945)"</a> & Tim Berners Lee's <a href="Berners-Lee_LongLiveWeb2010.pdf" target="_blank"> Long Live the Web(2010)</a></h2>
      <br>
      <p>In “As We May Think,” Vannevar Bush argues that the majority of the tools and inventions created by the early twentieth century amplified physical capabilities but failed to do the same for mental capabilities.  He urges scientists to push the boundaries in their respective fields.  This combined with effective record keeping and a continued reduction in costs to build more complex devices would help to boost innovation.  On the topic of innovation, the most intriguing portions of the article, Bush predicts massive advancements in areas of photography, storage, software, etc.  He goes on to describe a series of devices he believes could come about by this innovation.  Several of these devices and ideas exist almost eighty years later in the form of  PC’s, smart glasses, high resolution televisions, smartphone camera, and artificial intelligence.  Bush kept using the word “logical” while effectively predicting the future which I found fascinating.  It puts the mind of an innovator on display. </p>

      <p>The web also fits nicely into Bush’s predictions of the future.  What he did not include in his predictions however, is the host of vulnerabilities and concerns of the web, covered in Tim Berners Lee’s “Long Live the Internet.”  Lee argues that we must work to maintain the internet's guiding principles of freedom of speech, deventrreliazstion, net neutrality, etc in order to continue to boost innovation.  This would include fighting against the influences of governments and large corporations on the internet and working to limit the “closed worlds” he describes in the article.</p>

      <p>These two articles and minds compliment each other very well because they frame the concept of dynamic innovation that help to improve current inventions and develop new world changing advances as well.</p>
