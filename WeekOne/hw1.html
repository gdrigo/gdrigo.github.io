		<p>John Berger's "Ways of Seeing" was interesting in the way it described how our perspectives and understanding of things are so heavily dependent on several variables.  He also touches on how the intent of a work can be so easily changed with new technology that allow for original works to be copied and distributed on a host of different platform types.  Although I had thought about these ideas before, I had not realized how dramatically the "feeling" of a work could be changed within a few seconds based on a change in the background music or even what content I was consuming right before.  This made me think of the difference between seeing a work and understanding it.  Despite seeing exactly the same thing, all the other variables forced me to "understand" it differently.</p>
		<p>Another point was how each individual detail needed to hold its own weight within the larger picture.  This made me think of past web and graphic design projects I worked on.  I am very detail oriented so I made sure each detail was completely thought out and added meaning to the overall piece instead of only serving as ornamentation.  Berger portrayed this concept very well in the various examples he used where he zoomed in and out into the significant portions of different paintings.</p>
